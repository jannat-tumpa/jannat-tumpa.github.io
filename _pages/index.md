I am a 3rd year Graduate Student pursuing PhD in Computer Science at Marquette University located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Besides, I am current working as Graduate Assistant at my university. My Research interest includes Mobile Health and Computing as well as Medical imaging. 

Other than academic stuffs, I am passionate about women empowerment and have worked for co-founding ACM-W student chapter and serving as Graduate consultant. This chapter is working to reduce gender gap in tech.
