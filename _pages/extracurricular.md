<!-- This page aims at explaining clearly the goals and methods of my PhD.
If you read these words, I have probably contacted you to participate in it: if so, thanks a lot for taking the time to click on the link!

I hope this page will help you answer any question you might have, including why I contacted you and how you can help me.

If you still have unanswered questions after reading it, feel free to open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/gaalcaras/gaalcaras/issues) so I can improve this document.
